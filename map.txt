Dark blood stains cover the floor of this small enclosure. Cages and shackles hang from the ceiling, some still holding the skeletal remnants of whatever poor souls once were imprisoned here.

This jagged blade is still encrusted with blood from long ago.

Dark Altar
A huge black altar of stone takes up most of the space in this room, its sides and top covered in symbols. Although you cannot understand what they mean, just looking at them makes you shudder.
